# Todo-FrontEnd (React.js)

This is the frontend for the Todo App. It is built using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript** for a responsive and dynamic user interface.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- A running backend API (for example, the `todo-backend` API we previously set up)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-frontend.git
cd todo-frontend
```

### 2. Install the Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```
The development server will now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this in your browser to see the frontend application.

### 4. Building the Application for Production
To build the application for production, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a build directory with the optimized production version of your app.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
